Memory optimization for Visual Prompt Tuning

This repository is forked from offiacl repository of contains the official PyTorch implementation for "Visual Prompt Tuning" [ECCV 2022] : [KMnp/vpt](https://github.com/KMnP/vpt).


## Structure of the this repo (key files are marked with üëâ):

- `src/configs`: handles config parameters for the experiments.
  
  * üëâ `src/config/config.py`: <u>main config setups for experiments and explanation for each of them. </u> 

- `src/data`: loading and setup input datasets. The `src/data/vtab_datasets` are borrowed from 

  [VTAB github repo](https://github.com/google-research/task_adaptation/tree/master/task_adaptation/data).


- `src/engine`: main training and eval actions here.

- `src/models`: handles backbone archs and heads for different fine-tuning protocols 

    * üëâ`src/models/vit_prompt`: <u>a folder contains the same backbones in `vit_backbones` folder,</u> specified for VPT. This folder should contain the same file names as those in  `vit_backbones`

    * üëâ `src/models/vit_models.py`: <u>main model for transformer-based models</u> ‚ùóÔ∏èNote‚ùóÔ∏è: Current version only support ViT, Swin and ViT with mae, moco-v3

    * `src/models/build_model.py`: main action here to utilize the config and build the model to train / eval.

- `src/solver`: optimization, losses and learning rate schedules.  
- `src/utils`: helper functions for io, loggings, training, visualizations. 
- üëâ`train.py`: call this one for training and eval a model with a specified transfer type.
- `launch.py`: contains functions used to launch the job.



- The datasets can be downloaded following the official links. We split the training data if the public validation set is not available. The splitted dataset can be found here: [Dropbox](https://cornell.box.com/v/vptfgvcsplits), [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1mnvxTkYxmOr2W9QjcgS64UBpoJ4UmKaM?usp=sharing).

### Pre-trained model preperation

Download and place the pre-trained Transformer-based backbones to `params`. Note that you also need to rename the downloaded ViT-B/16 ckpt from `ViT-B_16.npz` to `sup-ViT-B.npz`.
